# particle_hydrodynamics
2d lagrangian-based fluid simulator. Currently runs smoothly with over 2000 particles, and further graphical optimizations should improve this. User can currently interact with the fluid via the mouse, and more features should hopefully be avilable soon. I'm also working on getting a compilable version using CMake instead of the Microsoft Visual Studio filesystem. 
A working executable is in the release folder. Stay tuned for more features.
